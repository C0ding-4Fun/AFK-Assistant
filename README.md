# AFK-Assistant
A cs file for Sanderling based Eve bot.

Gives audible warnings if the drones are idle, the drones are attacked, you are attacked or someone new arrives in local.
Gives audible warning if ore hold is open and full. No warnings if it is closed

Local should be open and the Local tab clicked once.

Configuration items are at the top of the file. All fairly obvious I hope.

However many people there are in Local when you start the code is the safe amount. If someone arrives or leaves local then it will sound an alarm.

Copy the code into your Sanderling window and start it
